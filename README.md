In this project, we have developed Angry Birds game using LibGDX and we have submitted the project ZIP file in the deadline for this project on the Google Classroom. To set up and run our project, download the ZIP file and unzip it and use IntelliJ IDEA to open the downloaded file. Use JDK 23 to configure the project and set the gradle configurations in the gradle section on the right side of the project panel to run configuration. Then an executable jar file will be ready which can be run from clicking the green play button at the top of the screen.

We have referred to LibGDX documentation and internet to understand the various libraries such as Box2D and World to implement the physics efficiently.
